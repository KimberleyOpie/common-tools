# Version:
# 1.0   24 March 2011.
#	Metadata was encoded in a python dict structure in a python script.
# 2.0   22 November 2011.
#	Metadata converted to JSON files, then combined into this pseudo-JSON
#	file to help capture everything in one place with comments.
#	Edits to the metadata values were provided by Paul Loto'aniu of the
#	Bureau of Meteorology following his trial of the original
#	python-netcdf-cf.20110324 code.
#
# This is not a valid JSON document.  Instead it presents, with examples, the
# standard and optional global and variable attributes that should (or can) be
# used to help create a standards-conforming (e.g., CF-compliant) NetCDF file.
#
# Use this document to guide the creation of collection-level, variable-level
# and file-specific metadata for your dataset.  Copy and paste the attribute
# names, edit the values, and create a valid JSON file for each level of
# metadata that makes sense for your application.  Use this document to also
# guide the collection of file-specific metadata that should be collected.

At about 1:30pm EST, these rainfall values from sites across the country are analysed onto 0.25x0.25 and 0.05x0.05 degree grids with limited quality control. A sophisticated analysis technique described in Jones et al. (2009) is used to correct for baises in the data resulting in gridded data that represents an approximately square area with sides of about 5 kilometres (0.05 degrees) resolution covering Australia.",
